# Modello
Experience museum galleries with a standard deck of cards.

Modello uses the "Harvard Art Museums" API to create several augmented reality experiences.  Each experience provides an opportunity to explore and learn about museum artwork.  

Currently, the artwork from the API is projected onto standard playing cards (Bicycle Rider).  Examples of future work include projection onto walls and other accessible items.


## Usage
Each card is programmed with a unique experience:

| Card           | Experience                                         |
| ---------------|:--------------------------------------------------:|
| King of Hearts | Projects a random image onto the card.

Cards not listed in the table don't yet have a programmed experience.  Yes, there's only one at the moment =P.

## Contributing
Contributions are more than welcome and greatly appreciated!

Snatch any empty card, create an experience, and make a PR.  If you're working on it for a while, create an issue so someone else doesn't choose the same card.

Exposing additional artwork metadata in the AR experience (name, description, date, etc... ) could provide a fun learning experience.

Please follow the Harvard Museums API [terms of use](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs).
