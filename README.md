# Modello
Experience museum galleries with a standard deck of cards.

Modello uses the "Harvard Art Museums" API to create an augmented reality experience.  The artwork from the API is projected onto standard playing cards (i.e. Bicycle Rider).

## Usage
Each card is programmed with a unique experience:

| Card           | Experience                                         |
| ---------------|:--------------------------------------------------:|
| King of Hearts | Project a random API image onto the card.

Cards not listed in the table don't yet have a programmed experience.  Yes, there's only one atm =P.

Contributions are more than welcome and greatly appreciated!

WE NEED MORE CARDS

Feel free to snatch any empty card, create an experience, and make a PR.  If you're working on it for a while, create an issue so someone else doesn't choose the same card.

Please follow the Harvard Museums API [terms of use](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs).
